# Food_Recommendation_System-using-Python

This Food Recommendation System project aims to
provide users

their
preferences. The system uses a variety of data, including the users dietary
requirements, past food choices and other relevant factors, to generate food
recommendations that are tailored to the users needs
and tastes

different cuisines, and make informed decisions about what they eat. The system
is particularly useful for people who have specific dietary requirements, such as
vegetarians, vegans, or people with food allergies or intolerances.The Food Recommendation System is based on machine learning algorithms that
analyse data from various sources to make accurate
and relevant fond
recommendations. The system is designed to continuously learn and improve
over time based on the user's teedback and new data.

The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and
understand,with features that allow users
to filter and sort their food
recommendations based on various criteria, such as cuisine, dietarv requirements,etc.
